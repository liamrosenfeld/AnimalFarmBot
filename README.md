# Sign-Bunny-Bot

A bot that generates a custom sign bunny whenever requested. All that you need to do is write `!bunny <message>` in a server where the bot is enabled and it generates something like:

```text
|-------------|
| THE QUICK   |
| BROWN FOX   |
| JUMPED OVER |
| THE LAZY    |
| DOG         |
|-------------|
(\__/) ||
(•ㅅ•) ||
/ 　 づ
```
